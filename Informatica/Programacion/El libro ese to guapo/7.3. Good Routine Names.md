# 7.3. Good Routine Names
A good name for a routine clearly describes everything the routine does.

In the routine's name, describe all the **outputs and side effects**.
- The cure is not to use less-descriptive routine names; the cure is to **program so that you cause things to happen directly rather than with side effects.**

Avoid meaningless, vague, or wishy-washy verbs

The routine suffers from a weakness of purpose, and the weak name is a symptom.

Don't differentiate routine names solely by number. The numerals at the ends of these names provide no indication of the different abstractions the routines represent.

Make names of routines as long as necessary. 9 to 15 characters. Routine names are often attached to object names, which essentially provides part of the name for free.

Use a description of the return value.

Use a strong verb followed by an object.
- In object-oriented languages, you don't need to include the name of the object in the procedure name because the object itself is included in the call.

Use opposites precisely. Using naming conventions.

Establish conventions for common operations.
