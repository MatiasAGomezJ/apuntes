# 11. The Power of Variable Names
## 11.0 Python Keywords
### 2.3.1. Keywords
The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here:
```python
False	class		finally		is			return  
None	continue	for			lambda		try  
True	def			from		nonlocal	while  
and		del			global		not			with  
as		elif		if			or			yield  
assert	else		import		pass  
break	except		in			raise
```
## 11.1 Considerations in Choosing Good Names
You can't give a variable a name the way you give a dog a name.

e.g. **Poor** Variable Names:
```python
x = x - xx; 
xxx = fido + SalesTax( fido ); 
x = x + LateFee( x1, x ) + xxx; 
x = x + Interest( x1, x ); 
```
e.g. **Good** Variable Names:
```python
Names balance = balance - lastPayment; 
monthlyTotal = newPurchases + SalesTax( newPurchases ); 
balance = balance + LateFee( customerID, balance ) + 
monthlyTotal; 
balance = balance + Interest( customerID, balance );
```
A good variable name is readable, memorable, and appropriate.
### The Most Important Naming Consideration
The name fully and accurately describe the entity the variable represents.
### Problem Orientation
A good mnemonic name generally speaks to the problem rather than the solution.
### Optimum Name
Names that are too short don't convey enough meaning.
The effort required to debug a program was minimized when variables had names that averaged 10 to 16 characters.

e.g. Variable Names That Are **Too Long**, **Too Short**, or **Just Right**:

Too long: 
```python
numberOfPeopleOnTheUsOlympicTeam
numberOfSeatsInTheStadium
maximumNumberOfPointsInModernOlympics
```
Too short: 
```python
n, np, ntm
n, ns, nsisd
m, mp, max, points
```
Just right: 
```python
numTeamMembers, teamMemberCount
numSeatsInStadium, seatCount
teamPointsMax, pointsRecord
```
### The Effect of Scope on Variable Names
When you give a variable a short name like *i*, the length itself says something about the variable.

Longer names are better for rarely used variables or global variables and shorter names are better for local variables or loop variables.

Adopt a convention for partitioning the global namespace and avoiding naming conflicts.
### Computed-Value Qualifiers in Variable Names 
If you modify a name with a qualifier like Total, Sum, Average, Max, Min, Record, String, or Pointer, put the modifier at the end of the name.

The part that gives the variable most of its meaning, is at the front.

Customary position of the ***Num*** qualifier:
Placed at the *beginning* of a variable name, Num refers to a **total**: **numCustomers** is the total number of customers.
Placed at the *end* of the variable name, Num refers to an **index**: **customerNum** is the number of the current customer.

Using Count or Total to refer to a total number of customers and Index to refer to a specific customer.
### Common Opposites in Variable Names
Use opposites precisely. Using naming conventions for opposites helps consistency, which helps readability. Pairs like begin/end are easy to understand and remember.
## 11.2 Naming Specific Types of Data
### Naming Loop Indexes
 The names *i*, *j*, and *k* are customary: 

e.g. of a **Simple Loop Variable Name** :
```java
for ( i = firstItem; i < lastItem; i++ ) {
	data[ i ] = 0;
}
```
If a variable is to be used outside the loop, it should be given a name more meaningful than *i*, *j*, or *k*.

e.g. of a **Good Descriptive Loop Variable Name**:
```java
recordCount = 0;
while ( moreScores() ) {
	score[ recordCount ] = GetNextScore();
	recordCount++;
}
```
Because code is so often changed, expanded, and copied into other programs, many experienced programmers avoid names like i altogether

e.g. of **Good Loop Names in a Nested Loop**:
```java
for (teamIndex = 0; teamIndex < teamCount; teamIndex++) {
	for (eventIndex = 0; eventIndex < eventCount[teamIndex]; eventIndex++) {
		score[teamIndex][eventIndex] = 0;} 
 } 
```
They also make array accesses clearer: 

`score[teamIndex][eventIndex]`
is more informative than 
`score[i][j]`.

**If you have to use** *i, j,* **and** *k*, **don't use them for anything other than loop indexes for simple loops**
### Naming Status Variables 
Status variables describe the state of your program.

Think of a better name than flag for status variables. It's better to think of flags as status variables. A flag should never have flag in its name because that doesn't give you any clue about what the flag does.

e.g. in C++ of **Better Use of Status Variables**:
```c++
if ( dataReady ) ... 
if ( characterType & PRINTABLE_CHAR ) ... 
if ( reportType == ReportType_Annual ) ... 
if ( recalcNeeded == True ) ... 

dataReady = true; 
characterType = CONTROL_CHARACTER; 
reportType = ReportType_Annual; 
recalcNeeded = false;
```
### Naming Temporary Variables 
Hold intermediate results of calculations

They're usually called temp, x, or some other vague and nondescriptive name

e.g. in C++ of "Temporary" Variable Name Replaced with a Real Variable**:
```c++
// Compute roots of a quadratic equation. 
// This assumes that (b^2-4*a*c) is positive. 
discriminant = sqrt( b^2 - 4*a*c ); 
root[0] = ( -b + discriminant ) / ( 2 * a ); 
root[1] = ( -b - discriminant ) / ( 2 * a ); 
```
### Naming Boolean Variables
e.g. of **Boolean Variables**:
```a
Done		Found		Success		Ok
```
Replace success with a more specific name that describes precisely what it means to be successful.

Give boolean variables names that imply true or false.
```a
isdone?	isError? isFound? isProcessingComplete? 
```
**Use positive boolean variable names**.
### Naming Enumerated Types
Group prefix, such as 'Color_', 'Planet_', or 'Month_'.

e.g. in Visual Basic of Using a Prefix Naming Convention for Enumerated Types
```visual
Public Enum Color    
	Color_Red    
	Color_Green    
	Color_Blue 
End Enum
```
### Naming Constants 
name the abstract entity the constant represents
*CYCLES_NEEDED* instead of *FIVE*.  *CYCLES_NEEDED* can equal 5.0 or 6.0. *FIVE* = 6.0 would be ridiculous.
## 11.3 The Power of Naming Conventions 
### Why Have Conventions? 
By making one global decision rather than many local ones, you can concentrate on the more important characteristics of the code.

They reduce name proliferation.

They compensate for language weaknesses.

If your language doesn't support objects, you can supplement it with a naming convention.

Adding structure to the code and giving you fewer things to worry about.
### When You Should Have a Naming Convention
- When multiple programmers are working on a project 
- When your programs are reviewed by other programmers in your organization
- When the program will be long-lived enough that you might put it aside for a few weeks or months before working on it again 
## 11.4 Informal Naming Conventions
### Guidelines for a Language-Independent Convention
Differentiate between variable names and routine names. Differentiate between classes and objects.

e.g.:
Each of these options has strengths and weaknesses.

**Option 1**: Differentiating Types and Variables via **Initial Capitalization**
```java
Widget widget;
LongerWidget longerWidget;
```
**Option 2**: Differentiating Types and Variables via **All Caps**
```java
 WIDGET widget;
 LONGERWIDGET longerWidget
```
**Option 3**: Differentiating Types and Variables via the **“t_” Prefix** for Types
```java
 t_Widget Widget;
 t_LongerWidget LongerWidget;
```
**Option 4**: Differentiating Types and Variables via the **“a” Prefix** for Variables
```java
 Widget aWidget;
 LongerWidget aLongerWidget;
```
**Option 5**: Differentiating Types and Variables via **Using More Specific Names** for the Variables
```java
 Widget employeeWidget;
 LongerWidget fullEmployeeWidget;
```
Identify named constants. RECSMAX or RECS_ MAX

Guidelines for Language-Specific Conventions
## 11.6 Creating Short Names That Are Readable
### General Abbreviation Guidelines
- Use standard abbreviations
- Remove all nonleading vowels.
- Remove articles: and, or, the, and so on. 
- Truncate consistently after the first, second, or third 
- Keep the first and last letters of each word. 
- Use every significant word in the name, up to a maximum of three words.
- Remove useless suffixes
### Comments on Abbreviations 
The general issue illustrated by this guideline is the difference between write-time convenience and read-time convenience. This approach clearly creates a write-time inconvenience, but programmers over the lifetime of a system spend far more time reading code than writing code.

Names matter more to the reader of the code than to the writer.
### Kinds of Names to Avoid
Avoid numerals in names.
