# 15. Using Conditionals
A conditional is a statement that controls the execution of other statements; if, else, case, and switch.
## 15.1 if Statements
- **if-then**
-  **if-then-else-if**

### Plain if-then Statements
#### Write the nominal path through the code first; then write the unusual cases
- Write your code so that the normal path through the code is clear.
- Make sure that the rare cases don't obscure the normal path of execution.

#### Put the normal case after the if rather than after the else.
- Put the case you normally expect to process first. Putting code that results from a decision as close as possible to the decision.

e.g. in Visual Basic of Code That Processes a Lot of Errors

#### Follow the if clause with a meaningful statement.
e.g. in Java of a Null if Clause
```java
if ( SomeTest ) {
	;
}
else {
	// do something
...
}
```
*Cross-Reference *
One key to constructing an effective if statement is writing the right boolean expression to control it.

e.g. in Java of a Converted Null
```java
if ( ! SomeTest ) {
	// do something
...
}
```

- One option is to code the else clause—with a null statement if necessary
- Use comments to explain why the else clause isn't necessary,

e.g. in Java of a Helpful, Commented else Clause
```java
// if color is valid

if ( COLOR_MIN <= color && color <= COLOR_MAX ) {
	// do something
...
}
else {
	// else color is invalid
	// screen not written to –- safely ignore command
	en Python debemos escribir pass
}
```
## 15.2 Chains of if-then-else Statements
### Simplify complicated tests with boolean function calls.
e.g. in C++ of an if-then-else Chain That Uses Boolean Function Calls

![example page .png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2TwLOvv864h5rskzgk10H7Z29jTDc_vtALK8HZakB4_MRRXD1oKXPKTJxvQ-pKAaeU5MS4onSx_Gw8A8sD6yuve8xavncpT2z7M59Rf5O9BsOb-pw8qutUpdcfGdJ5VS06qRUjSQ)

e.g. in C++of an if-then-else Chain That Uses Boolean Function Calls
```c++
if ( IsControl( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_ControlCharacter;
}
else if ( IsPunctuation( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Punctuation;
}
else if ( IsDigit( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Digit;
}
else if ( IsLetter( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Letter;
}
```
### Put the most common cases first.
Minimize the amount of exception-case handling code someone has to read.

Improve efficiency because you minimize the number of tests the code does to find the most common cases.

e.g. in C++ of Testing the Most Common Case First
```c++
if ( IsLetter( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Letter;
}
else if ( IsPunctuation( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Punctuation;
}
else if ( IsDigit( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Digit;
}
else if ( IsControl( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_ControlCharacter;
}
```
### Make sure that all cases are covered. 
Code a final else clause with an error message or assertion to catch cases you didn't plan for. 
e.g. in C++ of Using the Default Case to Trap Errors
```c++
if ( IsLetter( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Letter;
}
else if ( IsPunctuation( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Punctuation;
}
else if ( IsDigit( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_Digit;
}
else if ( IsControl( inputCharacter ) ) {
	characterType = CharacterType_ControlCharacter;
}
else {
	DisplayInternalError( "Unexpected type of character detected." );
}
```
### Replace if-then-else chains with other constructs if your language supports them.
## 15.2 Case Statements
### Choosing the Most Effective Ordering of Cases
#### Order cases alphabetically or numerically
If cases are equally important, putting them in A-B-C order improves readability.
#### Put the normal case first
Put the normal case first.
Comments 
#### Order cases by frequency
Human readers can find the most common cases easily.
Makes the search quicker.
### Tips for Using case Statements
#### Keep the actions of each case simple
If the actions performed for a case are complicated, write a routine
#### Use the default clause only to detect legitimate defaults
You might sometimes have only one case remaining and decide to code that case as the default clause. You lose the ability to detect errors with the default clause.
#### Use the default clause to detect errors
Put a diagnostic message in it
e.g. in Java of Using the Default Case to Detect Errors—Good Practice
```java
switch ( commandShortcutLetter ) {
	case 'a':
		PrintAnnualReport();
		break;
	case 'p':
		// no action required, but case was considered
		break;
	case 'q':
		PrintQuarterlyReport();
		break;
	case 's':
		PrintSummaryReport();
		break;
	default:
		DisplayInternalError( "Internal Error 905: Call customer support." );
}
```
#### In C++ and Java, avoid dropping through the end of a case statement.
You have to code the end of each case explicitly
## Comparing Switches and if-then Statements
▶▶ If you have a single variable that can take multiple values, a switch might be suitable.
▶▶ If you have multiple variables or conditions to consider, you will probably need an if-then statement.
▶▶ If the value you are considering can have a finite number of values, consider using a switch.
▶▶ Continuous range of numbers, consider an if-then
statement
